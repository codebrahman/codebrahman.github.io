Throughout my career, I have developed a reputation as an experienced software professional with the ability to architect and encourage the development of maintainable, testable, and scalable systems.

I am known to be a collaborative team-player with high emotional intelligence and the capacity to manage an engineering teamâ€™s day-to-day responsibilities within a fast-paced environment; highly skilled in building big data analytics systems.

Perhaps most important, I am an organized professional with a proactive mindset and a strong work ethic, able to oversee an engineering team to build, operate, and maintain software with a focus on meeting business and customer needs; able to contribute to the entire development lifecycle from concept to release and at every level of the tech stack.
